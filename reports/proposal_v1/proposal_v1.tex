\section*{Problem}

The goal is to have a descentralized network
that can provide historical geographical authentication.
Consider the following use cases.

\begin{itemize}
	\item A protester is found dead in a location distant from where the protest happened.
		Police argues the person was not even involved in the protest
		and died for unrelated causes;
		other protesters can use the network to contest police claims
		and show that this specific protester was indeed involved in the protest.

	\item A person from a racial minority is being accused of committing a crime.
		This person can use the network to show that the accusation
		is incompatible with the locations that the person has been
		during the time the crime happened.

	\item Some expensive lab equipment disappeared overnight.
		A student not involved with this situation
		can prove this by showing their location during that night
		is far away from the lab.

	\item A professor wants an attendance sheet for a class.
		The students can prove they were in class
		even after the class has ended.

	\item BBC wants to provide exclusive content for people located in London.
		People can prove that they indeed are that geographical location
		in order to have access to this content.
\end{itemize}


\section*{Motivation}

Besides simple geographical authentication,
there are situations in which historical data is useful,
to prove someone was or was not present in a certain situation.

Centralized solutions create a single point of failure.
Furthermore,
the reliability of the data can be compromised;
in the first example,
the government could try to coerce the centralized node
to censor or misrepresent data about the protester.
Having a decentralized solution eliminates this possibility.


\section*{Proposed Solution}
WE NEED TO DO THIS.

\section*{Milestones and Dates}
We need to sit down after class on Thursday and write this out concretely. Right now, I am thinking the following tasks will be necessary:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Minimally necessary:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Write a Python class that will allow us to simulate blockchains with arbitrary settings. Settings include:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Protocol for initiating a handshake
			\item Protocol for propogating handshake through network
			\item Rate of block creation
		\end{itemize}
		\item Write a Python class that will allow us, given a simulated blockchain, to implement it (probabilistically) with various ``populations'' of geometrically dispersed users
		\begin{itemize}
			\item i.e. a person is a unique ID together, together with a location in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
			\item interactions between persons A and B are a function of their distance (and possibly history of misbehavior...?)
			\item Should we write in adversarial and negligent nodes?
		\end{itemize}
		\item Create strong mathematical statements about the behaviors of frequent-collision block chains, with applications to local geographic identification in mind. I imagine some of this will be led by our manipulation of variables on paper, and that the rest will be led by our empirical observations from the simulations.
	\end{itemize}
	\item If we do a real implementation (i.e. outside Python simulation):
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Implement blockchain (with fixed parameters) in something like ROS
		\item Perform experiments with volunteers
		\item Analyze and visualize data
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Requested Resources}
\begin{itemize}
	\item At worst, we might need some extra computing power to run some large stochastic simulations...?
	\item If we wanted to, we could experiment with cheap wireless hardware and try to perform small-scale experiments.
\end{itemize}
